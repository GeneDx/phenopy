comment: Neurogenic bladder sphincter dysfunction (NBSD) can develop as a result of a lesion at any level in the nervous system, including the cerebral cortex, spinal cord, or peripheral nervous system. Neurologic conditions in children leading to neurogenic bladder dysfunction are predominantly congenital neural tube defects (including myelomeningocele, lipomeningocele, sacral agenesis, and occult lesions causing tethered cord). Acquired causes such as spinal cord tumors or trauma or sequelae of transverse myelitis are less frequent. Whereas from an etiologic standpoint neurogenic bladder dysfunction is a heterogeneous group, medical management will be similar irrespective of the underlying cause.

def: "Glaucoma refers loss of retinal ganglion cells in a characteristic pattern of optic neuropathy usually associated with increased intraocular pressure." [HPO:probinson, pmid:11815354]
comment: The feature that differentiates glaucoma from other causes of visual morbidity is a characteristic pattern of damage to the optic nerve head. This is most easily recognised at the superior and inferior poles of the optic disc. The vertical cup:disc ratio (VCDR) has proved to be a simple, relatively robust index of glaucomatous loss of the neuroretinal rim. As with intraocular pressure, VCDR is a continuous variable within the population.

comment: Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.
